<h3>TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS</h3>

      <P>There are actually two separate table implementations in
      HTMLgen now. The first was historically taken from the old
      HTMLsupport.py function library. It was
      designed to take a list of lists and construct a table correctly
      sized to contain the data, and allowed for some limited
      customization. For general table display it works fine and is
      named <strong>Table</strong> in this module.

      <P>The newer implementation was a result of feedback I got
      during the 1.2 beta releases. It is a collection of classes for the
      lower level table primitives, <strong>TD</strong>,
      <strong>TR</strong>, <strong>TH</strong> and
      <strong>Caption</strong> along with a simple container class
      called <strong>TableLite</strong>. I called it TableLite because
      it does very little for you, (but it does get out of the
      way). The user is thus responsible for structuring the contents
      of each row of the table as well as all other heading and border
      specifications with the appropriate mix of these classes.
      Although this requires more coding work on the user's part it
      does provide complete flexibility and control over the table
      construction. For those with special table needs, building
      custom classes on top of TableLite and friends may be the
      favored approach. <BR><img src="../image/note.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="N.B.">Please
      be aware though, that this approach can become a performance
      problem as all the low level elements are implemented as class
      instances. It'll be at least two times as slow as a more
      hardwired approach such as Table. (In particular, the
      <code>start_tag()</code> method is cool from a reuse perspective
      but is expensive in CPU cycles.)

<h3>FEATURES</h3>
   <h4>Table class</h4>
        <P>The Table class is instantiated with the table's name
        (which becomes it's caption), and then is tailored with
        various keyword parameters or direct attribute
        assignments. Several attributes control alignment, spacing,
        border characteristics. The default settings result in a table
        which looks much like the following. Border is set to 2, cell
        padding is 4, and overall width is 100%. For example the
        following code was used to generate the next table. 
<pre>
>>> t = HTMLgen.Table('Caption')
>>> h = ['head 1', 'head 2', 'head 3']
>>> t.heading = h
>>> l = ['one', 'two','three']
>>> t.body = [l]
>>> print t
</pre>

<A NAME="Caption"></A>
<P><TABLE border=2 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=1 width="100%">
<CAPTION align=top><STRONG>Caption</STRONG></CAPTION>
<TR Align=center> <TH ColSpan=1>head 1</TH><TH ColSpan=1>head 2</TH><TH ColSpan=1>head 3</TH></TR>
<TR> <TD Align=left>one</TD> <TD Align=left>two</TD> <TD Align=left>three</TD> </TR>
</TABLE>
        
      <P>The body attribute contains a list of lists, the length of
      which determines the number of rows in the table. The heading
      attribute is just a list of strings and determines the number of
      columns. The intent behind the Table class is to provide a
      simple interface using fairly natural Python datatypes as
      arguments. See the main manual for detailed documentation.

   <h4>The TableLite class(es)</h4>

    <P>The TableLite class is a general container class to be
      populated by instances from the TD, TR, TH, and Caption
      classes. All these classes inherit from AbstractTag like most
      other HTML markup classes. AbstractTag supports such things as
      append, prepend, copy, markup, as well as others. The following
      is a usage example.

<pre>
>>> TDlist = map(HTMLgen.TD, ['one', 'two', 'three'])
>>> body = HTMLgen.TR()
>>> body = body + TDlist
>>> THlist = map(HTMLgen.TH, ['head 1', 'head 2', 'head 3'])
>>> heading = HTMLgen.TR()
>>> heading = heading + THlist
>>> cap = HTMLgen.Caption('Caption')
>>> t = HTMLgen.TableLite(border=2, cellpadding=4, cellspacing=1,width="100%")
>>> t.append(cap, heading, body)
</pre>

      <P>This is obviously more complicated but is necessary when
        using low level classes such as these. Note: the defaults are
        only what the browser might use; the TableLite class provides
        no defaults like the Table class.

        <P>The examples below use the <em>barchart</em> module to generate
        tables which use the TableLite class.
