<h3>FEATURES</h3>

      <P>HTMLgen provides full form support using the POST method. It
      provides an Input class supporting all input types including
      script callbacks. The Input class also has two convenience
      attributes, <code>llabel</code> and <code>rlabel</code>, which
      place plain text to the left and right of the widget
      respectively. 
        <P>For persistant data between forms, see the StickyForm
        module donated by Amos Latteier.

      <P>Below is a Form containing all the input types.
