A Sample Template File</H2>

<HR WIDTH="100%">A template file is simply an HTML file (or any text file
for that matter), which contains symbols which mark where substitutions
will be made.&nbsp; The symbols are always delimited by curly braces {like_this}.&nbsp;
The name between the braces is a valid python symbolic name, i.e. alphanumeric
or underscore characters.&nbsp; The idea is that for each occurence of
these symbols a dictionary will be consulted using that key and the found
value is substituted in its place. Anything with a string representation
can be used as the substituted value, including other complex HTMLgen objects
such as tables, lists, etc.
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>The {TemplateDocument} class is instantiated with a template file and
then a dictionary, or an object which acts like a dictionary (has a get()
method) like UserDict, is assigned to the {substitutions} attribute. At
that point the instance can be written to a file and all substitutions
will be performed.&nbsp;&nbsp;
