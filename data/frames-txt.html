<h3>DESIGN</h3>

      <P>An individual web page can be broken up into multiple panes
      called frames. The definition of this subdivision is done by the
      FRAMESET element and thus the Frameset class. A simple document
      file is used to contain the Frameset and it's contents. HTMLgen
      provides the FramesetDocument class for this purpose. The
      characteristics of each frame are specified in the FRAME
      element. Typically the frame just points to a source file for
      it's display contents. Each frame has a name declared by which
      it may be refered to by other Href tags using a target
      attribute.

      <P>The resulting heirarchy looks like this:
      <UL><LI>FramesetDocument object contains one
          <UL><LI>Frameset object which contains two or more 
              <UL><LI>Frame objects each pointing to an HTML file.
                <LI>or other Frameset objects
              </UL>
          </UL>
      </UL>
