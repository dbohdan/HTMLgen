<h3>WHAT'S IT FOR?</h3>

      <P>HTMLgen is a class library for the generation of HTML documents
      with Python scripts. It's used when you want to create HTML
      pages containing information which changes from time to
      time. For example, you might want to have a page which provides
      an overall system summary of data collected nightly. Or maybe
      you have a catalog of data and images that you would like formed
      into a spiffy set of web pages for the world to browse. Python
      is a great scripting language for these tasks and with HTMLgen
      it's very straightforward to construct objects which are rendered
      out into consistently structured web pages. Of course, CGI
      scripts written in Python can take advantage of these classes as
      well. 

<h3>ABOUT THIS RELEASE</h3>
      
      <P>This is a minor release with a new module called NavLinks.py
      and several bug fixes and modifications to allow HTMLgen to be
      used with <a
      href="http://www.python.org/jpython/">JPython</a>. <B>Note: This
      version of HTMLgen REQUIRES Python 1.5 or later.</B>
      
      <P>The NavLinks module provides tools by which a series of HTML 
      documents can be annotated with navigation links which page the
      user through the files. Several styles of navigation aids are
      included and new ones can be easily derived from the class
      framework. 
      
      <P>The TemplateDocument scheme has been rewritten with the
      addition of a new base class StringTemplate with
      TemplateDocument and new classes AutoTemplateDocument and
      AutoStringTemplate inheriting from it. The TemplateDocument
      class provides a simple way of generating web pages based on a
      template containing tags which are replaced at run time with
      text of your choice. It uses a dictionary to provide the
      substitution mapping. This class is only available with Python
      1.5 or newer as it makes use of the re module and the new get
      method on dictionaries. 


      <P>The release can be <a
      href="http://starship.python.net/crew/friedrich/HTMLgen.tgz">downloaded</a>
      from the Starship Web site.
      

<h3>ARCHITECTURE</h3>

      <P>HTMLgen uses a simple model of having a separate class for each
      HTML element type.  Each class instance supports an __str__
      method to emit itself as HTML text markup.  A SimpleDocument class
      provides the general container object which the user populates
      with objects from the markup classes.  The SeriesDocument class also
      provides a general style template for page generation based on
      Patrick Lynch's <a
      href="http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/manual/contents.html"> Web
      Page Style Manual</a> at the Yale Center for Advanced
      Instructional Media.  See that page for more insights into the
      design of good web pages.

<h3>NOTES ON NAMING</h3>

      <P>The names I've selected for the classes in this module may need
      some explaining. There is a class for each of the common HTML
      elements and all classes use initial upper case for their
      name. All functions are lower case. I did not choose to use all
      caps for the classes that correspond to elements as A) HTML
      markup isn't case sensitive anyway and B) I hate typing things
      in all caps and C) I tend to use all-caps names to signify
      constants. I also modified the class names to make them more
      descriptive than the HTML standard. For example, I use Image
      rather than IMG in hopes that the longer names will be easier
      for the user to remember while coding the Python scripts. Also
      there is no A class. I use the Href class to specify hyper-
      references, (mostly because it's easier for me to remember). A
      little odd case is the Paragraph vs. P classes. The former class
      is used as a normal paragraph text container and uses the /P
      token while the latter is simply used to insert a &lt;P&gt;
      break in the output stream. Even though the class names might be
      'Emphasis' rather than 'EM', I have provided aliases for these
      classes so that if you insist, you can use the HTML names as the
      class names.

<h3>DISTRIBUTION</h3>

      <P>This release comes with a mini-web of pages generated with
      the tool.  The HTMLtest.py is the script used to build several
      pages in the html subdirectory. It functions both as a test case
      as well as usage examples. The reference manual output from
      gendoc-0.6 is there as well.  Input data is read from the data
      directory and images used are all in the image directory.  Once
      untaring the files simply run the test function:

<pre>
>>> import HTMLtest
>>> HTMLtest.test()
wrote: "./html/overview.html"
wrote: "./html/document.html"
wrote: "./html/lists.html"
wrote: "./html/top-frames.html"
wrote: "./html/frames.html"
wrote: "./html/tables.html"
wrote: "./html/forms.html"
wrote: "./html/imagesmaps.html"
wrote: "./html/scripts.html"
wrote: "./html/independence.html"
wrote: "./html/parrot.html"
wrote: "./html/colorcube.html"
</pre>

      <P>This should print the html files it generates as
      above. Browse them (well you <em>ARE</em> browsing them now I
      guess) to be sure things aren't hosed. The navigation buttons
      should work, etc.  After you are satisfied just place
      HTMLgen.py* and HTMLcolors.py* into your PYTHONPATH (and any of
      the other modules you want to use) and have fun.

      <p>Comments are most welcome. <br> I've added a simple script
      called <strong>colorcube.py</strong> which generates a 
      <a href="./colorcube.html">web-safe color table</a> useful for
      selecting colors for your pages. Two additional sample pages are
      available as well. They are accessed by clicking the "Next"
      button on the last on-line doc page (Scripts). If you want to
      jump to them directly you can click <A
      HREF="./independence.html">here</a>.

<font size=-1>If you're curious about the insect at the bottom of each
page, that's my alma mater's mascot.</font>
