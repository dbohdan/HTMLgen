      <P>The List class and it's children have been structured to
      allow full nesting of either regular Python data types, (e.g.,
      lists of lists of strings) or HTMLgen objects. For example, an
      OrderedList class can contain an instance of the List class,
      ImageBulletList class and DefinitionList class. Added in version
      2.0.6 is the capability to render the list into multiple
      columns. Just set the <code>columns</code> attribute to a number
      greater than one and it will use that many columns. Also added
      is the ability to assign a background color through the use of
      the <code>bgcolor</code> attribute.

        <UL>
        <LI><STRONG>List</STRONG> class uses the UL markup and 
          is the base class for:
          <UL>
            <LI><strong>OrderedList</strong>, which uses the OL markup.
            <LI><strong>DefinitionList</strong>, which uses the DL markup.
            <LI><strong>ImageBulletList</strong>, which uses the UL markup and just
              provides a simple <em>object object BR</em> style for 
              each list item.
            <LI><strong>NonBulletList</strong>, which uses the UL markup and just
              provides a simple indented list without prepending a
              bullet (or anything else).
          </UL>
        </UL>

      <P>The Netscape Navigator extension <code>type</code> tag is
      supported as an attribute of the List and OrderedList classes
      and can be set as keyword parameters (although they have
      different meanings).  In List instances you can set the
      <code>type='disk' | 'circle' | 'square'</code> to hardwire the
      style of bullet used. In OrderedList instances you can set
      <code>type='A' | 'a' | 'I' | 'i'</code> to alter the numbering from
      Arabic to respectively: capital letters, small letters, Roman
      numerals, small Roman numerals.

      <P>Normal list operations apply to all the classes in this family
      as the base class inherits from the UserList class provided in
      the core distribution.

      <P>The rendered HTML output should also exhibit indentation
      proportional to the level of list nesting.

      <P>Below is some example output. See the HTMLtest.py script for the
      source code which generated it.
