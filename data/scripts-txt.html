<h3>FEATURES</h3>

      <P>A recent addition is support for scripting languages in
      Netscape. This was primarily intended for JavaScript&reg;, but
      other scripting languages available through plug-in support such
      as <em>you-know-what</em> may also be triggered. The callback
      attributes, (<code>onChange, onBlur, onFocus, onSelect</code>),
      have been placed in the appropriate classes throughout
      HTMLgen. They show up mostly in the Forms objects but the
      <code>onLoad</code> and <code>onUnload</code> callbacks are
      available to the Document class as well.

      <P>The Script class is the container of the script body
      itself. The Document class has an attribute called script. This
      can be set to either an instance of the Script class or a
      sequence of such instances. It'll be emitted in the HEAD portion
      and will therefore be loaded into browser memory before any of
      the page contents which might use the functions defined
      there. Script instances can be placed in the body of the
      document but be aware that functions must be defined before they
      are referenced. (OK that's obvious to you I know.:-)

        <P>To see a couple sample generated pages click the Next Page
        button. (It has nothing to do with Scripts but this page in
        the last one in primary documentation series.)
