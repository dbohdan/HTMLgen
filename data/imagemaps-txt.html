<h3>FEATURES</h3>

      <P>Both client and server side imagemaps are supported. The test
      area below uses client side imagemaps. One starts with an image
      and identifies the areas which are to be linked to URLs. This is
      done with Area class instances which are then assigned to a Map
      object. That Map object is then grouped with the image via a
      normal Image class. A minimal example:
<pre>
    a1 = Area(coords='0,0,50,50', href='a1.html')
    a2 = Area(coords='0,50,50,100', href='a2.html')
    csmap = Map(name='rect', areas=(a1,a2))
    csimage = Image('../image/csmap_rect.gif', usemap='#rect')
</pre>
      <P>Note that the name tag must be referenced with the #name
      syntax for this to work. Also, both the Map object and the Image
      object must, of course, be included in the document file for
      client side maps to work.
