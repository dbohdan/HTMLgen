<H2>The Dead Parrot Sketch</H2>
<HR>

 


 
A customer enters a pet shop.

 


<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 'Ello, I wish to register a complaint.
 


 
(The owner does not respond.)

 


<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 'Ello, Miss?
<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 What do you mean "miss"?
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 I'm sorry, I have a cold. I wish to make a complaint!
<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 We're closin' for lunch.
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 Never mind that, my lad. I wish to complain about this parrot what I
 
purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.

<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 Oh yes, the, uh, the Norwegian Blue...What's,uh...What's wrong with it?
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 I'll tell you what's wrong with it, my lad. 'E's dead, that's what's
 
wrong with it!

<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 No, no, 'e's uh,...he's resting.
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 Look, matey, I know a dead parrot when I see one, and I'm looking at one
 
right now.

<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 No no he's not dead, he's, he's restin'! Remarkable bird, the Norwegian
 
Blue, idn'it, ay? Beautiful plumage!

<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 The plumage don't enter into it. It's stone dead.
<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 Nononono, no, no! 'E's resting!
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 All right then, if he's restin', I'll wake him up!
 
(shouting at the cage)

 
'Ello, Mister Polly Parrot! I've got a lovely fresh cuttle fish for you if

 
you show...(owner hits the cage)

<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 There, he moved!
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 No, he didn't, that was you hitting the cage!
<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 I never!!
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 Yes, you did!
<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 I never, never did anything...
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 (yelling and hitting the cage repeatedly) 'ELLO POLLY!!!!!
 
Testing! Testing! Testing! Testing! This is your nine o'clock alarm call!

 


 
(Takes parrot out of the cage and thumps its head on the counter. Throws it

 
up in the air and watches it plummet to the floor.)

 


<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 Now that's what I call a dead parrot.
<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 No, no.....No, 'e's stunned!
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 STUNNED?!?
<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 Yeah! You stunned him, just as he was wakin' up! Norwegian Blues stun
 
easily, major.

<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 Um...now look...now look, mate, I've definitely 'ad enough of this. That
 
parrot is definitely deceased, and when I purchased it not 'alf an hour ago,

 
you assured me that its total lack of movement was due to it bein' tired and

 
shagged out following a prolonged squawk.

<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 Well, he's...he's, ah...probably pining for the fjords.
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 PININ' for the FJORDS?!?!?!? What kind of talk is that?, look, why did he
 
fall flat on his back the moment I got 'im home?

<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 The Norwegian Blue prefers keepin' on it's back! Remarkable bird, id'nit,
 
squire? Lovely plumage!

<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot when I got it home, and
 
I discovered the only reason that it had been sitting on its perch in the

 
first place was that it had been NAILED there.

 


 
(pause)

 


<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 Well, o'course it was nailed there! If I hadn't nailed that bird down, it
 
would have nuzzled up to those bars, bent 'em apart with its beak, and VOOM!

 
Feeweeweewee!

<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 "VOOM"?!? Mate, this bird wouldn't "voom" if you put four million volts
 
through it! 'E's bleedin' demised!

<BR>
<STRONG>Owner: </STRONG>
 
 No no! 'E's pining!
<BR>
<STRONG>Customer: </STRONG>
 
 'E's not pinin'! 'E's passed on! This parrot is no more! He has ceased to
 
be! 'E's expired and gone to meet 'is maker! 'E's a stiff! Bereft of life,

 
'e rests in peace! If you hadn't nailed 'im to the perch 'e'd be pushing up

 
the daisies! 'Is metabolic processes are now 'istory! 'E's off the twig!

 
'E's kicked the bucket, 'e's shuffled off 'is mortal coil, run down the

 
curtain and joined the bleedin' choir invisible!! THIS IS AN EX-PARROT!!
